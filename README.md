- 2D Jump'n'run
- made with Unity
- my first GameDev Project

As foundation serves the 7.5h long [Beginner's GameDev Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1F9G0JXOo) from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) but I realized it with exclusively self-made art and a few additional elements not mentioned in the tutorial.
Please view Crocky in the Sewer as part of a beginner's learning process. It doesn't aspire to deliver hours of fun and elaborate mechanics, but represents the small fruit of the first 3 to 4 weeks of GameDev self-teaching.
