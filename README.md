- 2D Jump'n'run
- made with Unity
- my first GameDev Project
As foundation serves the 7.5h long "Beginner's GameDev Tutorial" from www.freeCodeCamp.org but I realized it with exclusively self-made art and a few additional elements not mentioned in the tutorial.
Please view Crocky in the Sewer as part of a beginner's learning process. It doesn't aspire to deliver hours of fun and elaborate mechanics, but represents the small fruit of the first 3 to 4 weeks of GameDev self-teaching.
